## Roadmap

Version 1.0
- It comes up with the recipes

Version 1.1
- Advanced Panel
	- Budgetify (Removes avocado, pearl barley, etc.)
	- Seasonify (Removes non-seasonal vegetables)
	- Falafel Wrap Mode (Only shows falafel wraps)
	- Americanify (Refers to aubergine as egg plant)
	- Allergifree (Option to remove nuts)

Version 7.0
- Use A.I. to identify more succesful combinations, like falafel and red onion (Help wanted)
